**Image Colorization** is the process  of assigning colors to a grayscale image to make it more aesthetically appealing and perceptually meaningful. These are recognized as sophisticated tasks than often require prior knowledge of image content and manual adjustments to achieve artifact-free quality. But using Deep learning models like RCNN etc this task can be done via AI and ML. In this simple web app we have implemented a CNN model with a custom architecture and have created a UI to drop images and get the processed images back as downloadable files.
